# Spark Homepage Image Audit

## Quality Bar (from manifesto reference images)

The manifesto reference images set the standard. Key traits:
- **Vivid red/orange lobsters** as mascot characters — always prominently featured
- **Rich color palettes** — NOT monochrome blue. Best examples use: sunset oranges/ambers (day-one), vivid red lobsters (zero-employees, army-grows), green accents (ships-while-you-sleep), warm browns and earth tones
- **White/light backgrounds** dominate — the world is bright and alive
- **Characters doing things** — lobsters typing at desks, leading robot armies, teaching classes
- **16-bit pixel art** with visible pixel grid and retro charm
- **Wide panoramic format** — horizontal, story-telling compositions

The SOUL.md brand tension: "Serious message. Joyful delivery." The visuals must be ALWAYS bright, warm, alive.

## Image-by-Image Audit

### 1. evolution-banner.jpg
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Hero banner (top of page) |
| **Section** | Hero — full-bleed banner |
| **Dimensions** | ~2400×800 (wide panoramic) |
| **Grade** | **A** |

**Assessment:** The flagship image. Nails every brand criterion.
- ✅ 16-bit pixel art — clear pixel grid, retro game aesthetic
- ✅ Blue-dominant with rich tropical color — sky blue BG, plus browns, greens, reds, skin tones
- ✅ Light blue background
- ✅ No text baked in
- ✅ Tells a great story — evolution from apes → caveman → farmer → office worker → guy riding a lobster
- ✅ Lobster is vivid red/orange — prominent, iconic
- ✅ Wide panoramic format
- ✅ Whimsical but smart — captures "serious message, joyful delivery" perfectly

**Needs regeneration?** No. This is the gold standard.

### 2. command-center.jpg
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Activity Pulse section (dark section) |
| **Section** | "The factory never stops." |
| **Dimensions** | Wide panoramic |
| **Grade** | **B** |

**Assessment:** Acceptable for the ONE dark section per page.
- ✅ 16-bit pixel art
- ⚠️ Very dark navy/black dominant — but contextually appropriate (dark section)
- ❌ Not white/light background — intentionally dark for the dark section
- ⚠️ Tiny text on screens (decorative code/data — borderline acceptable)
- ✅ Tells a story — lobster commanding a global operations center with robot workers
- ✅ Lobster is vivid red/orange — center stage, great contrast against dark
- ✅ Wide panoramic format
- ✅ Whimsical but smart — spy thriller meets cute lobster commander

**Issues:** Could use slightly more brightness/contrast. The cyan accents are the only relief from near-black. Compared to manifesto's og-manifesto.png (also dark), this is denser and moodier.

**Needs regeneration?** No, but could be improved. Acceptable for the dark section.

---

### 3. factory-floor.jpg
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Ethos 1 — statement section (left image) |
| **Section** | "The factory is the product." |
| **Dimensions** | Wide panoramic |
| **Grade** | **B+** |

**Assessment:** Strong isometric pixel art, slightly too monochrome.
- ✅ 16-bit pixel art — excellent isometric style
- ⚠️ Blue-dominant but lacking tropical color — almost entirely shades of blue/ice. Only the small red lobster breaks the monotone. Compare to manifesto's day-one.png which has sunset oranges, warm browns, etc.
- ✅ White/light blue background visible
- ⚠️ Has small "OK" speech bubble text (minor)
- ✅ Tells a story — robots on assembly line, lobster supervising from platform, machines processing
- ✅ Lobster is vivid red/orange — small but visible
- ✅ Wide panoramic format
- ✅ Whimsical but smart — isometric factory is clever and detailed

**Issues:** Too blue-monochrome. Needs warm accents (orange warning lights, green status indicators, amber gears) to match the "rich tropical color" standard.

**Needs regeneration?** Borderline. Acceptable but would benefit from more color variety.

---

### 4. infinite-workshop.jpg ⚠️
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Ethos 2 — statement section (right image) |
| **Section** | "What would you build if labor was free?" |
| **Dimensions** | Wide panoramic |
| **Grade** | **C** |

**Assessment:** Great composition, completely off-brand palette.
- ✅ 16-bit pixel art
- ❌ Blue monochrome — NO tropical color whatsoever. Entirely shades of steel blue and grey-blue. Cold and lifeless.
- ✅ Light blue sky background
- ✅ No text baked in
- ✅ Tells a story — one person at a desk overlooking a vast robot city under construction. Powerful concept.
- ❌ **No lobster anywhere in the image**
- ✅ Wide panoramic format
- ⚠️ Smart but not whimsical — feels somber and lonely rather than joyful

**What's wrong:**
1. No lobster — the brand mascot is completely absent
2. Zero color variety — just blue, blue, blue. The manifesto's zero-employees.png and army-grows.png prove you can do "vast scale" with vivid color
3. Tone is melancholy rather than "joyful delivery"
4. This is a KEY ethos section with a CTA ("Read the Manifesto") — it needs energy

**Needs regeneration?** YES. Add vivid red lobster, add warm color accents, make it feel alive and possible rather than cold and lonely.

### 5. orchestrator-dashboard.jpg ⚠️
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Featured product card (The Orchestrator) |
| **Section** | Products — featured |
| **Dimensions** | Wide panoramic |
| **Grade** | **C** |

**Assessment:** Dark image in a white section. Has baked-in text.
- ✅ 16-bit pixel art
- ❌ Very dark navy/black background — this is the SECOND dark image on the page (command-center is first). Brand rule: max 1 dark image per page.
- ❌ Not white/light background — dark navy fills 90%+ of the image
- ❌ **Text baked in** — "terminal" on left screen, "DEPLOYMENT" and "STAGE" labels on right screen. Violates the no-text rule.
- ✅ Tells a story — lobster at multi-monitor command dashboard
- ✅ Lobster is vivid red/orange
- ✅ Wide panoramic format
- ⚠️ Smart concept, but dark aesthetic undermines whimsy

**What's wrong:**
1. Dark background in a white section creates visual jarring
2. Baked-in text ("terminal", "DEPLOYMENT", "STAGE") 
3. Second dark image violates the single-dark-section principle
4. The "glowing cyan" aesthetic veers toward the banned "neon/glow" territory

**Needs regeneration?** YES. Needs light/white background. Remove baked text. Keep the multi-monitor concept but make it bright and airy.

### 6. claw-school-campus.jpg ⚠️
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Featured product card (Claw School) |
| **Section** | Products — featured |
| **Dimensions** | Wide panoramic |
| **Grade** | **C** |

**Assessment:** Good concept, wrong lobster color.
- ✅ 16-bit pixel art — nice classroom scene
- ⚠️ Blue-dominant but monochrome — dark navy bookshelves, blue robots, blue teacher. Lacks color variety.
- ✅ Light blue/white background areas
- ✅ No text baked in
- ✅ Tells a story — lobster teaching a class of robot students
- ❌ **Lobster is BLUE, not red/orange** — the teacher lobster/crab is rendered in blue tones, making it blend into the blue world. The brand requires vivid red/orange lobster. Compare to zero-employees.png where every lobster is screaming RED.
- ✅ Wide panoramic format
- ✅ Whimsical — classroom full of robots is charming

**What's wrong:**
1. Lobster/teacher is BLUE instead of vivid red/orange — kills the brand tension
2. Too monochrome blue — no warm accents. The bookshelves could have colorful book spines, the whiteboard could have warm-colored diagrams
3. Without the red lobster pop, there's no focal point

**Needs regeneration?** YES. Lobster MUST be vivid red/orange. Add color variety to the classroom.

### 7. analytics-observatory.jpg ⚠️
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Product grid card (Eagle Eye Analytics) |
| **Section** | Products — grid |
| **Dimensions** | Wide panoramic |
| **Grade** | **C** |

**Assessment:** Clever concept, completely blue-washed.
- ✅ 16-bit pixel art
- ❌ Blue monochrome — the lobster, telescope, observatory, charts are ALL blue. Zero color variety.
- ⚠️ Light blue edges but interior skews darker
- ✅ No readable text
- ✅ Tells a story — lobster looking through telescope at data constellations in an observatory
- ❌ **Lobster is completely BLUE** — invisible against the blue world. Should be vivid red/orange.
- ✅ Wide panoramic format
- ✅ Smart concept — observatory as analytics metaphor

**What's wrong:**
1. Lobster is blue — completely lost in the scene
2. Zero tropical color — just navy, steel blue, and cyan
3. The observatory interior is too dark for a product card on a white section

**Needs regeneration?** YES. Red/orange lobster. Add warm accent colors. Brighten the interior.

---

### 8. launch-pad.jpg ⚠️
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Product grid card (Instant Hosting) |
| **Section** | Products — grid |
| **Dimensions** | Wide panoramic |
| **Grade** | **C** |

**Assessment:** Pleasant but lifeless.
- ✅ 16-bit pixel art
- ❌ Light blue monochrome — entirely one shade of blue. No tropical color at all.
- ✅ Light blue background
- ✅ No text baked in
- ✅ Tells a story — computer-monitor rocket launching from a pad, robots watching
- ❌ **No lobster anywhere**
- ✅ Wide panoramic format
- ⚠️ Cute concept but the washed-out palette makes it feel flat

**What's wrong:**
1. No lobster — the brand mascot should be commanding the launch
2. Completely monochrome light blue — feels like a faded blueprint
3. No warm/tropical accents — the rocket exhaust could be orange, the control tower could have amber lights
4. Feels empty and washed out compared to manifesto reference images

**Needs regeneration?** YES. Add vivid red lobster. Add color (orange rocket flames, green control lights, amber displays).

---

### 9. toolkit-workbench.jpg ⚠️
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Product grid card (Starter Kits) |
| **Section** | Products — grid |
| **Dimensions** | Wide panoramic |
| **Grade** | **C-** |

**Assessment:** Technically competent but fails every brand story test.
- ✅ 16-bit pixel art — nice isometric workbench
- ❌ Blue monochrome — entirely shades of blue. Not a single warm pixel.
- ✅ Light blue/white background
- ✅ No text baked in
- ⚠️ No real story — it's a still life of tools. Nobody is doing anything. Compare to manifesto images where every scene has characters in action.
- ❌ **No lobster**
- ✅ Wide panoramic format
- ❌ Not whimsical — sterile, cold, static

**What's wrong:**
1. No lobster — no brand anchor
2. No character doing anything — it's tools sitting on a table. Where's the robot building something? Where's the lobster selecting a kit?
3. Blue monochrome — blueprints, tools, robot arm all the same shade
4. The least engaging image on the entire page

**Needs regeneration?** YES. Needs a lobster or robot character actively assembling/selecting kits. Needs color variety.

---

### 10. theme-gallery.jpg
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Product grid card (Dashboard Themes) |
| **Section** | Products — grid |
| **Dimensions** | Wide panoramic |
| **Grade** | **A-** |

**Assessment:** Best product card image. Closest to manifesto standard.
- ✅ 16-bit pixel art
- ✅ Blue-dominant with real color variety — blue monitors, orange/amber monitor on right, brown desk, scattered color swatches in blue AND warm tones
- ✅ Light grid/white background
- ✅ No readable text
- ✅ Tells a story — lobster designing/comparing dashboard themes at multiple monitors, paint palette in hand, color swatches scattered
- ✅ **Lobster is vivid red/orange** — prominent center stage
- ✅ Wide panoramic format
- ✅ Whimsical but smart — lobster as an artist/designer with paint supplies

**Minor issues:** Could push the warm colors slightly more. The orange monitor is great — could have more moments like that.

**Needs regeneration?** No. This is the product card standard the others should match.

---

### 11. trading-floor.jpg
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Product grid card (Trades) |
| **Section** | Products — grid |
| **Dimensions** | Wide panoramic |
| **Grade** | **B** |

**Assessment:** Good storytelling, acceptable color balance.
- ✅ 16-bit pixel art
- ⚠️ Blue dominant with some color — white floor, dark navy screens. Lobster provides the red pop. Lacks other warm accents.
- ⚠️ Mixed — white floor is bright, but large dark trading screens dominate upper half
- ✅ No readable text (charts are decorative)
- ✅ Tells a story — lobster on a chaotic trading floor, robots at terminals, papers everywhere
- ✅ **Lobster is vivid red/orange** — center stage
- ✅ Wide panoramic format
- ✅ Whimsical — lobster as a Wall Street boss is funny

**Issues:** The dark trading screens create a lot of dark mass. Could use green "up" arrows, amber price tickers, red warning lights for more color variety.

**Needs regeneration?** No, but would benefit from a refresh with more color accents.

---

### 12. archive-vault.jpg ⚠️
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Location** | Product grid card (Tweet Vault) |
| **Section** | Products — grid |
| **Dimensions** | Wide panoramic |
| **Grade** | **C+** |

**Assessment:** Beautiful concept, missing the mascot and color.
- ✅ 16-bit pixel art — gorgeous vault detail
- ❌ Blue monochrome — vault, robot, birds all rendered in blue tones
- ⚠️ Mixed — right side is light, left vault area is darker
- ✅ No text baked in
- ✅ Tells a story — massive vault door swinging open, tweets (as birds) flying out, small robot watching
- ❌ **No lobster** — just a small blue robot
- ✅ Wide panoramic format  
- ✅ Smart concept — vault releasing tweets-as-birds is clever

**What's wrong:**
1. No lobster — should be the lobster opening the vault or guarding it
2. Blue monochrome — the birds (tweets) could be various colors, the vault could have warm metallic tones (gold, brass)
3. The small robot isn't a brand character — it's generic

**Needs regeneration?** YES. Add red/orange lobster. Give the birds color. Add warm metallic tones to the vault.

## Critical Issues (Across All Images)

### 1. 🔴 Missing Lobsters (4 images)
**infinite-workshop, launch-pad, toolkit-workbench, archive-vault** have NO lobster mascot at all. The lobster is the brand's signature character. Every image should feature it.

### 2. 🔴 Blue Lobsters (2 images)
**claw-school-campus, analytics-observatory** render the lobster in BLUE tones, making it disappear into the blue world. The manifesto reference images (zero-employees.png, army-grows.png) prove the lobster must be VIVID RED/ORANGE to create the brand's signature color pop.

### 3. 🔴 Blue Monochrome Epidemic (8 images)
Only **evolution-banner** and **theme-gallery** have meaningful color variety. The brand promises "blue-dominant world with RICH tropical color." Most images deliver "blue-only." The manifesto references use: sunset oranges, warm browns, vivid reds, greens, ambers. The homepage images are 90% cold blue.

### 4. 🟡 Too Many Dark Images (2+ in white sections)
**command-center** is appropriate for the dark section. But **orchestrator-dashboard** is also very dark and sits in the white products section. The brand allows max 1 dark image per page. Several other images (analytics-observatory interior) also skew dark.

### 5. 🟡 Baked-In Text (1 image)
**orchestrator-dashboard** has readable text: "terminal", "DEPLOYMENT", "STAGE". Brand rule: NO text baked into images.

---

## Regeneration Priority

### Highest Priority (featured/above-fold)
1. **orchestrator-dashboard.jpg** — Featured product card. Dark BG + baked text. Must fix.
2. **claw-school-campus.jpg** — Featured product card. Blue lobster. Must fix.
3. **infinite-workshop.jpg** — Ethos section with CTA. No lobster + monochrome. Must fix.

### Medium Priority (product grid)
4. **analytics-observatory.jpg** — Blue lobster, monochrome
5. **launch-pad.jpg** — No lobster, monochrome
6. **toolkit-workbench.jpg** — No lobster, no story, monochrome (worst overall)
7. **archive-vault.jpg** — No lobster, monochrome

### Optional Refresh (acceptable but improvable)
8. **factory-floor.jpg** — Could use more color variety
9. **trading-floor.jpg** — Could use more color accents

---

## Specs for Imager (Regeneration Requests)

Each regenerated image should follow these universal rules:
- 16-bit pixel art, visible pixel grid
- Blue-dominant world but with RICH warm accents (oranges, ambers, greens, reds)
- White or light blue background (NOT dark)
- Vivid red/orange lobster as the main or prominent character
- NO text baked into the image
- Wide panoramic format (1400×600 for product cards, 1400×500 for statements)
- Match the quality bar of evolution-banner.jpg and theme-gallery.jpg
- Reference manifesto-style/ images for the target aesthetic

**Use theme-gallery.jpg as the product card standard.** It proves you can have blue-dominant pixel art WITH warm color variety AND a red lobster AND storytelling.
